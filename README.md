# Automated Water Dispenser Project

Description:
The Automated Water Dispenser Project is a smart solution designed to provide users with a convenient, hygienic, and precise way of dispensing water into containers. The project utilizes Arduino-based hardware coupled with ultrasonic sensors to accurately measure water levels in the reservoir and detect the presence of containers for filling. The software, developed using Arduino programming language, controls the dispensing process, ensuring controlled filling and efficient water usage. The project aims to streamline the process of filling water containers while minimizing wastage and manual effort. Future improvements may include incorporating advanced user interfaces and remote monitoring capabilities for enhanced functionality and user convenience.

A water dispenser system designed using Arduino, capable of dispensing water while monitoring the water level in a container. The system ensures efficient water management by controlling the dispenser pump based on the water level in the container.

Features

Water Level Monitoring: Ultrasonic sensors are employed to accurately measure the water level in the container, ensuring optimal usage and preventing overflow or depletion.
Automatic Dispensing: Upon detecting a recipient under the dispenser, the system automatically activates the pump to dispense water, providing a convenient and hands-free operation.
Real-time Feedback: Utilizes an LCD screen to display real-time information about the water level and system status, ensuring user awareness and interaction.
Error Handling: Incorporates error handling mechanisms to alert users in case of empty reservoir or malfunction, enhancing system reliability and user experience.
